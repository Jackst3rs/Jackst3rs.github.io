	<p>Looking for a fun spunky lunch place to spice up that day of relaxation for
	you? Well look no further than <strong>Allen's Arcade and Sandwiches</strong>!<br><br>
	Established all the way in the 90's, Allen has been running this arcade since he
	bought it from the original owners, except this time hes selling burgers out of it.
	Knowledgable gamers will get a kick out of Allens naming scheme for the sandwhiches.
	With a double decker cake bunned sanwhich called "The Sanwhich is a Lie", those of
	the digital age will love the style and pizazz of this joint.<br><br>
	Even if you're not well acquanted with the games of today, there still is a full
	arcade lurking in the back room. It houses over a hundred mint condition retro
	games and pinball machines.<br>
	This is a perfect space for both old enjoyers of the classic games, and children
	alike! They can become educated on where their favorite video games
	originated from, all while snacking on some delicious fries!<br><br>
	If the nerdy and geeky aren't your style, or youre just looking for an elegant
	date night experience, then <strong>Jacques authentic Oiseau Bar and Grill</strong>
	is what you need.<br><br>
	Built into a vintage Ouiseau castle, a strict dress code is required to make you
	and your date look the best you can be. And don't worry, the food is just as good.
	After training for over 15 years, the head chef, Jacques, can produce food that
	only the highest level of chef could only dream of!<br>
	The steaks are to die for and they are paired with the most perfect selection of
	wine money can buy. They also have a signature special, the <strong>Feast of the Harrier</strong>.
	A 5-course meal filled with the most well seasoned and delectable poultry your eyes
	will ever lay on. And you likely will be laying down, as the chef has a reputation
	for not letting customers off the hook without stuffing themselves with the finest
	food money can buy.<br><br>
