	<br><p> Here in Summerbridge theres a little something for everyone. Whether
	its you and the folks, or just you yourself! We pride ourselves on having
	a type of business for everyone.<br>
	Starting off in the outskirts, there's plenty of food to keep everyone fed,
	and with that, theres entertainment too!<br><br>
	The <strong>Fairman's Carnival</strong> is a weekly fair that shows up
	nearly every weekend to let you blow off some steam with friends after
	a hard workweek.
	It's got fried food, adult drinks, entertainment, and rides to keep 
	everyone in the family busy! Especially the kiddos with all of the fun
	carnival attractions!<br>
	Nearing the end of the night, the carnival turns into a real spectacle 
	with fireworks seen best from the giant ferris wheel near the entrance.</p><br class="clearL">

	Inner downtown is home to many businesses, most notable being the 
	<strong> Fisherman's Marina and Aquarium</strong>. At this aquarium,

	Floor Exhibit!</strong> There, the Fisherman's boasts to having the most
	realistic experience of what it would be like to live on the sea floor!
	<br>But if the dark adventurous waters aren't your style, feel free to check
	their more light hearted exhibits! 
	The pirate exhibit is particularly popular with kids and couples alike!<br>
