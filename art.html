	<br><br><p> Looking for a beautiful night on the town just to experience the 
		wonderful culture of the region? Look no further than <strong>
		St. Henrietta's Church and Museum</strong>.<br>
		Here, you can experience the life of a real 20th century nun! The 
		church is wonderfully preserved from when it was first built back in
		1908, with only slight elegant signs of aging.<br><br>
		Don't worry, theres also stuff for the kiddos here as well!<br>
		At the museum, kids are encouraged to take free sketchbooks and 
		markers provided at the front counter and draw to their hearts content!
		Here in Summerbridge we value the childrens education in the arts
		and want to show little artists that they can one day be present
		in the gallery as well.<br><br>
		And at <strong> Summerbridge Academy and Gallery</strong>, they 
		truely can show their art!<br>
		Not only is there free art classes to those living in the Summerbridge
		area, but the gallery hosts a once a year showing of children's art. 
		Specifically those that decide to draw while at the Gallery or the Museum!
		<br><br>Not interested in the fine arts or in the religious history of
		the area? That's ok!<br>
		A museum specifically for kids and car lovers recently opened up in
		downtown Summerbridge, called the <strong>Ness Car and Transport Museum</strong>.
		<br>While it may not sound exciting on paper, this museum allows 
		passengers to ride in the most iconic hotrods of the past in virtual reality.
		Along with that it hosts the history of Summerbridge's claim to fame, the
		<strong> real summer bridge</strong> supposedly built in the 1800s by 
		the first settlers in the region.<br><br>
