	<p class="clearL"> While a beautiful hotel like that is perfect for those
	looking for that beach getaway, for more rustic types theres also a perfect
	place for you.<br><br>
	Home to one of the largest forests in the Kilmaine region, campsites are
	a plenty, but one we wholeheartedly endorse is the <strong>Sleepy Deer Lodge</strong>.
	Known more for its urban location in Rafferty, the Sleepy Deer Lodge is 
	somehow even more homey than a log cabin could be!<br><br>
	It features a rustic all wood interior with gorgeous views of the sun setting
	over the trees on higher floors. It's mascot, the Sleepy Deer himself
	often time shows up during the breakfast on the lodge's main floor,
	making it an adorable photo op for families with young kids.<br>
	It's perfect for the lovebirds in your life too, with plans to expand into
	the forest with individual cabins for those looking for a more private
	experience.</p>
	<p>Looking for something even closer to home? Then the <strong>William's Bed
	and Breakfast</strong> is for you!<br><br>
	built in the early 1900s, this bed and breakfast exhudes hometown charm. Pictures
	of family members pepper the walls of the rented rooms, making you feel
	included in the family, despite them being polite and out of your way except
	for at breakfast time.</p>
	<p>If any of these sound good to you, don't wait until you're already stressed
	from work to book.<br>
